BUGS IN C CODE:
 ---
16 - The memberships thread needs to be able to handle a return value of -8
(CONNECTION_CLOSED).
7 - For guaranteed messages, performance suffers if a group has lots of members because the member list is searched linearly.  It could be stored in a btree instead.
10 (FIXED) - There's a memory leak, because old versions of membership lists are never deleted.  (Fixed with the introduction of the memberships_purge_old_lists() code; deleting old versions is expensive, so it's only done if they are using more than memory than LIST_MEM_IS_BIG - defined at compile time - and there are more than three versions. )
11 - Handling of common errors needs to be improved.  Example: what happens if the spread daemon crashes and restarts.
12 - Many of the values that are configured at compile-time should be configurable at runtime.

LINKER BUGS:
14 - In the message API code, I can use MySQL's internal thread routines -- but
libtspread is still going to directly use libpthread code.
15 - I have tested the UDF on FreeBSD and OS X, but still have not confirmed 
that it links and runs correctly on Linux.  This is going to depend a great 
deal on pthreads, and on the mysql include files being correct for the target
system.

BUGS IN BUILD & INSTALL SCRIPTS:
 ---
13 - It's not always correct to install the .so file in /usr/local/lib
