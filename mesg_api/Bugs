BUGS IN C CODE:
 ---
7 - For guaranteed messages, performance suffers if a group has lots of members because the member list is searched linearly.  It could be stored in a btree instead.
10 (FIXED) - There's a memory leak, because old versions of membership lists are never deleted.  (Fixed with the introduction of the memberships_purge_old_lists() code; deleting old versions is expensive, so it's only done if they are using more than memory than LIST_MEM_IS_BIG - defined at compile time - and there are more than three versions. )
11 - Handling of common errors needs to be improved.  Example: what happens if the spread daemon crashes and restarts.
12 - Many of the values that are configured at compile-time should be configurable at runtime.



BUGS IN BUILD & INSTALL SCRIPTS:
 ---
1 - It's not always correct to install the .so file in /usr/local/lib
