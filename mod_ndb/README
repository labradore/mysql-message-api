This is mod_ndb, an Apache module that provides a REST Web Services API for
MySQL Cluster.


--- BUILDING THE MODULE ---

MySQL Cluster and Apache must be installed, including all header files and 
shared libraries.

# ./configure --mysql=/path/to/mysql_config --apxs=/path/to/apxs
# make
# make install

Note that this configure script is not GNU Autoconf (which is not required, 
since it has already been run to build MySQL), but rather a small script which
can use the "mysql_config" and "apxs" commands to generate an appropriate 
Makefile for mod_ndb.


--- STARTING THE SERVER ---

1) Refer to the additional documentation in About-mod_ndb.html; you will need
a LoadModule directive in httpd.conf, and a number of available [API] nodes 
in your cluster configuration.

2) Apache must be able to load several NDB and MySQL libraries from 
the mysql lib directory (e.g. /usr/local/lib/mysql); you may need to set 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order to make this happen.

3) If the server starts and attempts to initialize mod_ndb, there will be 
one or more notices in the Apache server log file; either,

[notice] Cannot connect to NDB Cluster

-- indicating failure, or a succesful notice like:

[notice] Process 457 connected to NDB Cluster as node 5


--- BUILD NOTES FOR VARIOUS PLATFORMS ---

If you have a thread-safe mysql client library, configure mod_ndb with --thread-safe 

On 64-bit linux you may need to build MySQL with
  CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --with-ndbcluster --with-pic=yes
to avoid a linker error 



Enjoy!
