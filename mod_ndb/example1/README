	Example1: Two tables from a web application.

The "session" table holds name/value information associated
with an integer session key.

The "user_icon" table holds a set of image icons for users. 


LOADING THE DATA

The SQL script load_sessions.sql will create the mod_ndb_test database, create the session table, and load the data.  To load the full example:

  mysql < load_sessions.sql
  gunzip load_icons.sql.gz
  mysql mod_ndb_test < load_icons.sql


COFIGURING THE SERVER

The file ex1_httpd.conf should be included in an httpd.conf file,
e.g. "Include /path/to/mod_ndb/example1/ex1_httpd.conf"


RUNNING THE TEST SUITE

The files beginning with "t" form a test suite.  These tests require the "curl" binary.

First edit base.test (in case your base URL is somoething other than http://localhost/), then run the tests individually.

Test t1 selects all the data from session 3.
Test t2 modifies a row of data in session 3.
Test t3 repeats test t1; note the modified row.
Test t4 inserts a new row of session data.
Test t5 demonstrates the use of the ndb_select_all utility and shows the row created by t3.
Test t6 deletes the row created in test t4.
Test t7 repeats test t5; note the deleted row.


THE ICONS TABLE

There are no included tests for the icons table, but you should be able to view the JPEG images from a browser.   For example, the icon for  { user_id=3, icon_id=1 } will be visible at the URL
  
   /ndb1/icon/3/1
