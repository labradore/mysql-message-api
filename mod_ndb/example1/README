Example1: two tables from a web application.

The "session" table holds name/value information associated
with an integer session key.

The "user_icon" table holds a set of image icons for users.

The file ex1_data.sql is a SQL script used to create the tables and
load the data.

The file ex1_httpd.conf should be included in an httpd.conf file,
e.g. "Include /path/to/mod_ndb/example1/ex1_httpd.conf"

The files beginning with "t" are a test suite for the session table.

The tests require the "curl" binary.

First, edit base.test, then run the tests individually.
