#summary Installing the Message API

= Installing the Message API =


===Install MySQL===
   * The {{{mysql_config}}} script and MySQL's C and C++ header files are required for building the Message API.

===Install and configure Spread===
   * It's available from [http://www.spread.org/].  Before using the Message API, you should have a working _spread.conf_ file and running Spread daemons, and you should be able to use the _spuser_ utility to send a test message.

===Download and unpack the Message API source distribution===
   * from the "Downloads" page here.  Binary distributions are also available for some platforms. 

=== Run "configure", "make", and "make install" ===
   * This will create a file called {{{message_api.so}}} and install it in /usr/local/lib/.  (However, note that some Linux distributions, which do not use the GNU dynamic linker, require you to move the file from /usr/local/lib/ into /usr/lib)

=== Create the SQL functions ===
   * Execute the {{{create_functions.sql}}} script in your MySQL server
